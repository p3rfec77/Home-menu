# **Home Menu**

## This project for me and my girlfriend in order to simplify choosing what to cook

## **Aim of the project**

The main aim of the project (except practicing and improving my skills) is to make our home life easier. Almost every day we have to decide what to cook, and this can last hours. So i decided solve this problem and create WebApp where we can add our own dishes and create home menu for our couple. It'll help us to save time and resolve conflicts

## **For whom**

First of all this webApp for me and my girlfriend, but it can be useful for everyone who has same problem with choosing what to cook

## **plans for the future**

Now this app is using localeStorage to contain data, so you can't get access to your own menu from different devices, so I'm planning to realise signUp/SignIn and contain data in database using Firebase.

Also, I would like to add subcategories in main menu section.
